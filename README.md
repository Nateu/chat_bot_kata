# Basic premise
Designed for replit, but can easily be altered to run locally.
This Kata is meant te help with practising Behavior Driven Development on a unit test level.
Working in Python and with a test runner called Mamba, make a chat bot that uses a simple model for messages and has some basic features (see below).

### Running unit tests:
Click the **run** button in replit

Or in a shell
> mamba --format=documentation specs/*_spec.py

### Running the bot in console mode:
> python bot.py

* To chat simply write a message
* To change user, say **change user <user_name>**
* To change group, say **change group <group_name>**
* To stop the bot, say **bye** in chat

# Kata - instructions and features
Use the message class to create a message that will be received,
for now only the body property (first arg) needs to be used!

## Feature 1: Theme
The bot should be able to parse a message for a command to retrieve 
and set a theme.

## Feature 2: Case insensitivity
The bot should handle commands ignoring upper/lower case differences.

## Stepping up
The bot should be context aware, assume it's always in 2 or more groups
with multiple members that chat in the group.  

_Note: Start using the full Message class from this point forward._

Each message will come with a sentBy and a sentIn identifier,
denoting the user that spoke and in which group.  

## Feature 3: Group theme
When a theme is set it should be set only for the context of that group.  

## Let's put in some security
Introduce a role for administrators; these should be the same regardless
of group context. The bot owner is always an administrator and wil always
have the sentBy identifier **owner**.  
_Note: Assume the system will display the sentBy identifier, so it can be used by the owner as a reference._

## Feature 4: Only the owner can make someone administrator
Only an Admin set the theme for a group, anyone can retreive it.  

## Feature 5: Administrator only options
Only an Admin set the theme for a group, anyone can retreive it.
